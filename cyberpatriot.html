                    <h1>CyberPatriot VIII</h1>
                    <p>Going into the field of cyber security is initially a daunting task. When you first approach it there is a steep learning curve that you need to climb in order to get yourself acquainted with what is actually happening around you in cyber space. For me, I felt that the best way would be to jump straight into a guided scenario that put me in a competitive scenario, hence a cyber defense competition. I stumbled upon the CyberPartriot competition be chance and it seemed to fit my needs. As the competition describes its self:
                    <blockquote>At the center of CyberPatriot is the National Youth Cyber Defense Competition. The competition puts teams of high school and middle school students in the position of newly hired IT professionals tasked with managing the network of a small company. In the rounds of competition, teams are given a set of virtual images that represent operating systems and are tasked with finding cybersecurity vulnerabilities within the images and hardening the system while maintaining critical services.  Teams compete for the top placement within their state and region, and the top teams in the nation earn all-expenses paid trips to Baltimore, MD for the National Finals Competition where they can earn national recognition and scholarship money.â€‹</blockquote>
                    I began looking to put together a team. I talked about it with some people and rather quickly assembled a group that wanted to join. After finding a teacher to sponsor us, we convinced the school to let us compete under their district. After the registration was complete we moved on to compete in the preliminary rounds that would place us in our competition tier. We performed fairly well and were placed at the Gold level which is the second most difficult, just under the top tier Platinum. Then the competition rounds began. If we performed well enough we would be selected to move on to the finals. Over these competitions we excelled, I directed and delegated my team and we were repeatedly placing high on the scoreboard each round. Having performed well, we placed second within our state and moved on to the regional round. Unfortunately, in the regional round we were just below the number of points that we needed to continue onto the semi-finals round, ending our time in the competition. Despite this, it was a very important event. It solidified my decision to peruse a bachelors degree in cybersecurity, exposed me to some of the day to day activities of someone in the field, and taught me about the inner workings of the internet.</p>
                    <p>After the event concluded, our school district wrote this<a href='http://www.kingstoncityschools.org/news.cfm?story=117838'> article</a> about our time in the competition.</p>
