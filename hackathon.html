                        <p>During my first year at college, my college's chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) held a hackathon competition. The theme was a mystery box, each team would choose a box and whatever was inside was what you had to work with. Our box contained a computer monitor, a Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) gamepad, and a Raspberry Pi. When we were first brainstorming we decided that we should use the DDR pad as a controller for something. It was suggested that we connect it to one of my teammate's Roombas that he kept in his room. Following this idea, I suggested that we use the Raspberry Ri connected to a mobile battery as the Roomba's controller as well as attach a camera to the Raspberry Pi and use the monitor that was in our box to watch the feed. With this setup we would be able to drive the Roomba remotely as long as it was within WIFI range.</p>
                        <p>Using the <a href='https://www.irobot.com/filelibrary/pdfs/hrd/create/Create%20Open%20Interface_v2.pdf'>resources</a> provided by Roomba about the robot's open interface, we began putting together basic operation commands and slowly coded it to perform more complicated operations. The most simple was to drive forward. We began the testing with a laptop plugged directly into the Roomba's serial port, allowing us direct control without the possibility of any connections in-between malfunctioning. Once we got the forward motion working and moving at a reasonable speed, we moved onto directional driving. After that was implemented we scripted vacuum and brush controls. By the time we had all of the commands scripted we had about 12 hours left until the hackathon ended and so far we hadn't implemented any of the items given to us in our mystery box. At this point we began implementing the DDR pad as a control. To accomplish this we used the PyGame library which allowed up to map our control commands to the control pad. I then set up the wireless sockets to transmit the controls between the host computer and the Raspberry Pi. Finally we set up a webcam on the Raspberry Pi that streamed over wifi to the host computer and was put on the provided monitor. The functions that were available at the end were full directional steering as well as controls for both vacuums and all brushes. By this time we were ready to present but still had a couple of hours before the competition ended and decided to add a final feature that implemented the Roomba's sound capabilities and I transcribed the beginning of The Emperor's March from Star Wars into MIDI, adding a useless but personal feature to the project.</p>

                        </div></br>
                        <p>When we presented the project we left the Roomba outside of the room in the hall and put the camera feed on a projector in the room. We set up the controls and turned on the feed and drove it into the room with the Emporer's March playing as it came through the doorway and I navigated it to the front of the room. Our team ended up taking third place for the competition. A good outcome for it having been my first hackathon competition and I learned how I can improve my projects for the future events.</p>
