                            <h1>About Me</h1>
                            <p>My name is Jonathan Koppelman and I am a Software Engineer at Bank of America for their private mortgage credit team. I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a B.S. in Computer Science and in Information Technology Web Sciences. 
                                I have always been engaged by the cross-section of algorithms and finance. I emphasize taking initiative to stay connected and educated on the newest strategies for utilizing machine learning to generate profit in the derivative markets through 
                                analyzing research papers and experimenting on my own.</p>
                            <p>I am currently employed as a software engineer at Bank of America. I build full stack applications for the front-office private mortgage credit desk. Through my experience working with the desk, I have been able to demonstrate that I am personable and easy to work with. 
                                I was able to talk to the traders about possible future aspects of the product based on the desired needs due to my research on their line of business in my spare time. 
                                I was also able to hone my quantitative skills by engineering the prototype of an algorithm that would organize deals by predicted risk. </p>
                            <p>These work experiences, combined with my academic coursework and interpersonal skills, have advanced my interest in finance and computer science, and I am eager to take the next step toward a career in quantitative analysis.</p>

                            <p>I'll walk you though some of my hobbies. First and foremost, I like to make people laugh. It is best to describe me as a situational comedian. I would tank if you put me on a stage in front of a crowd. However, in a group of my friends and family
                                I feel like a modern day Jerry Seinfeld.
